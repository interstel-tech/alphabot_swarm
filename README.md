# alphabot_swarm
Code to deploy on AlphaBots to test the STTR swarm control algorithms.  
Initial work performed by **RI** for STTR Phase 2E.

---

## Requirements

### Hardware
- 4 Ã— AlphaBot2-Pi 
- 8 Ã— Decawave MDEK1001 (UWB sensor)   
- 4 Ã— SparkFun ICM-20948 (IMU)  
- 4 Ã— CP2112 (I2Câ€“USB Converter)

### 3D Printed Parts
- 4 x Mount for UWB, IMU, and I2C-USB converter

- 8 x Spacer for ball casters

**Note:** Spacers may need to be adjusted by +-1mm due to AlphaBot2-Pi tolerance

## Setup

### Ultra-Wideband Sensors
1. Download the **Decawave Software Package**.  
2. Flash the UWB sensors using **J-Flash Lite**.  
3. Use the **Decawave Android app** to configure sensors as anchors or tags. The maximum anchors allowed in the software is 4.

## Run Instructions
0. Login to the GUI for the RPI OS and configure the AlphaBots to the same Wi-Fi. Note their ip addresses.
1. Compile: make swarm_child.cpp and swarm_controller
2. Run `./swarm_child '{"nodename":"child_XX"}` on all robots, where XX is from 01-03.
3. Run `sudo python3 position_udp_main.py` on all robots (requires restarting once on first run after reboot)
4. Run `./swarm_controller` on a computer on the same network as the AlphaBots.
5. Run the `control_demo.sh` script.

**Note:** For more ideal initial trajectories, all robots should be setup starting at 0 degrees (facing +x-direction)

### Programs:
1. ssh_keyboard_drive.py: Control robot with WASD
2. imu.py: Reads orientation data using IMU 
3. uwb.py: Reads x,y position data using UWB sensors
4. position_udp_main.py: Main driver code

### Known Limitations and Issues:
1. On running position_upd_main.py for the first time on RPI boot, you'll notice it starts spinning after receiving a position command. After stopping the script and restarting, this problem with the IMU will not appear again until another reboot.
2. UWB sensors may ocassionally go down and require a restart (unplug/replug)
3. Velocity is fixed during movement.

### Future work:
1. Re-incorporate Madgwick filter and EKF back into positioning code.
2. Consider increasing robot velocity.
3. Implement fine-grained convergence to target position.


## Configure & Build
This repo uses CMakePresets for its build configurations.

See the available presets by running the following in the root folder of the project:
```
cmake --list-presets
cmake --build --list-presets
```
Example configuration and build for the `linux-debug` preset:
```
cmake --preset linux-debug
cmake --build --preset linux-debug -j4 --target swarm_child swarm_controller copy_agent
```
Example configuration and build for the `rpi-debug` preset:
See the section below for installing the RPI cross-compiler first before building for RPI.
```
cmake --preset rpi-debug
cmake --build --preset rpi-debug -j4 --target swarm_child swarm_controller copy_agent
```
The compiled binaries will be in the build/<rpi/linux>-<debug/release> folder.

# Installing the RPI Cross-compiler
The Raspberry PI on the AlphaBot uses version 2.36 of GLIBC, so the latest version of the toolchain we can use is version 12.
```
localuser@raspberrypi:~ $ ldd --version
ldd (Debian GLIBC 2.36-9+rpt2+deb12u7) 2.36

The toolchain can be found here: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads

Arm GNU Toolchain
Version 12.2.Rel1
x86_64 Linux hosted cross toolchains
AArch32 GNU/Linux target with hard float (arm-none-linux-gnueabihf)

Change folders to the /opt folder to use as the root install directory for toolchains:
```
cd /opt
```
Download the toolchain:
```
sudo wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/12.2.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz
```
Extract:
```
sudo tar xvf arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz
```
Remove the compressed file, which we no longer need:
```
sudo rm arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz
```
